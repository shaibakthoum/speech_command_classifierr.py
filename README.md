Overview
The Speech Command Classifier is a Python-based tool that listens for specific voice commands and performs corresponding actions. It supports commands like "start", "stop", "pause", and "exit". The tool uses the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe audio into text, then processes recognized commands to trigger actions.

Features
Real-Time Command Recognition: Recognizes basic commands like "start", "stop", "pause", and "exit".
Custom Command Support: Future expansion to train custom commands.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple CLI-based tool for voice command interaction.
Performance Monitoring: Measure recognition time and accuracy.
